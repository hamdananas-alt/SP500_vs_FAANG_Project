## Business Objective
The goal of this project is to assess the financial health and trends of the S&P500 index and a newly created FAANG index, representing the five major technology companies (Facebook/META, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). By analyzing their historical performance, volatility, and correlations, the project aims to determine whether investing exclusively in the FAANG stocks could serve as a viable alternative to investing in the broader S&P500.

## Data Collection & Cleaning
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance  
- **Time Horizon:** Last five years (automated daily updates)  
- **S&P500:** Raw market data including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume was downloaded and cleaned. Missing values were forward- and backfilled, and zeros were treated as missing.  
- **FAANG Index Construction:** Each stockâ€™s OHLCV data was averaged across the five companies to create a single representative index. Volume was summed to maintain market activity representation. We assumed this approach allows direct comparison between FAANG and the S&P500 on equal footing.  

## Metrics & Calculations
For both S&P500 and FAANG, the following metrics were computed:  
- **Price & Volume:** Daily closing prices and trading volumes.  
- **Moving Averages:** 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages to identify trend patterns.  
- **Bollinger Bands:** 20-day moving average Â± 2 standard deviations to capture volatility envelopes.  
- **Daily Returns:** Percentage change day-over-day to understand short-term profitability.  
- **30-Day Rolling Volatility & Annualized Volatility:** Measures of price fluctuation and investor sentiment.  

All calculations are automated in Python and output as CSVs, which are dynamically updated and visualized in Tableau dashboards.
We had to use a work around through Google Sheets to enable Tableau public to have access to the daily updated csv files.
